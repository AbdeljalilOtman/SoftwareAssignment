You must put your remarks here :

- The app  does not work on all environments.
app errors : 
      - if you create a league 'A' and you reopen the app you can not modify the league 'A' .
      - you can create a league with only spaces , in other term empty name .
      - you can create a team with empty player names.
      - in the plays part , you can enter a negative number in the score.
      - it's better to make the team validation not finale because we might have a player that quits the league.
database management errors :
      - no security
      - the modifications on the database aren't permanent (you lose all the informations after closing the app)
